# n8n-nodes-zabbix

![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n/master/assets/n8n-logo.png)

A module consuming the [Zabbix API](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/5.0/en/manual/api).

## If you have n8n installed: Install custom nodes module
Install it to the n8n root folder. This is the node_modules folder on the same level of n8n and n8n-core. This differs when you used the -g flag on n8n initial installation. From there do:

npm install n8n-nodes-zabbix

## Fresh install n8n
Navigate to desired folder, create a package json and install n8n like so:

```
cd /var/www/vhosts/

mkdir my-n8n && cd my-n8n

npm init --yes

npm install n8n

npm install n8n-nodes-zabbix
```
## Start n8n
Directly:

```n8n```

Plesk or C-Panel:

```node /var/www/vhosts/n8n/bin/n8n```
